    <h1>Valentines Letter</h1>

    <p id="card">Happy Valentine’s Day my love! <br><br>

        This year’s Valentine’s Day is a special one for us. Not only does it mark our love for each other, but it symbolizes our first year in the flat. Moving in has had us fighting like cats and dogs at times, testing each other’s patience. Even though we disagree about things, there is one thing for certain, we both want to reach a solution. Because we know we’re better than any obstacle. <br> <br>
        
        Moving in together has never felt so right. Making that couch our bitch is something we can be really chuffed with ourselves for. <br><br>
        
        I’m so incredibly proud of you enduring this new adventure at Varsity College ;). Takes guts to do what you’re doing, but your future self will be cutting big cheques sooner than you think. No doubt it’ll get hard along the way, but you’ve got a solid support system and me. I’ll always be there for you. <br> <br>
        
        Thank you for always supporting me, making me sandwiches and always cleaning up after me. Not only for doing it but being willing to do it. <br><br>
        
        P.S. I hope you enjoy the little website. I know it’s nothing extravagant, but it’s made of everything I know so far, next year we can compare again! <br><br><br>
        
        I love you my girl. <br><br>
        Keep being you. </p>
